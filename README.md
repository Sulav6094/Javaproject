# Why are we doing this?
The purpose of this project was to build a basic Spring Boot book application connected to a MySQL database with CRUD functionality. 
It tests my ability to build a simple back-end Java application that utilises a MySQL database to carry out HTTP Requests. 
The project was an opportunity to display my understanding so far, of software development,
the technologies I have been learning with QA, as well as incorporating project management methodologies into my work flow.
# How I expected the challenge to go.
Initially, I was nervous to take on the challenge of the project as it was my first project and 
I had spent a short amount of time on the course learning a vast amount of information. 
My biggest concerns regarded time constraints, particularly as the project involved incorporating project
management practices that I hadn’t utilised before. However, I knew I had all the resources I needed to 
complete my project and I had references to look back if I came across any problem.
# What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Using Jira to plan took some time as I did not spend much time in it before the project. 
Building the application itself was fine and I felt comfortable doing it but it was hard 
making sure that I followed github feature branch model.
Using MySQL again didn’t start off so good as I had forgotten my credentials and my laptop was causing me some 
issues, however once I had sorted that out, I was fine with managing my database and getting my Postman requests 
to work was relieving. Testing took up a lot more time than I had wanted and it caused some frustrations however overall, 
things seemed to work out in the end and I was relieved. Things went smoothly and I was able to do it before time.
# Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
The program is basic and does all the minimal. 
However, in the future it would be nice to put in more data and more functions that can do more than CRUD.
